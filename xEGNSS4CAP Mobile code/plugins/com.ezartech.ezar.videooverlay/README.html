<h1 id="ezarvideooverlaycordovaplugin">ezAR VideoOverlay Cordova Plugin</h1>

<p>This plugin overlays the Cordova WebView on top of a custom camera view which provides <br />
a video preview. Using the VideoOverlay JavaScript api you can switch between the front <br />
and back cameras of a device, start and stop video preview from a camera and adjust the <br />
zoom level of the camera. </p>

<p>When a camera is started its video output is displayed on the ezAR camera view. By default <br />
the camera view is not visible as it is hidden below the WebView's HTML content. <br />
Increase the transparency for the area(s) of the app UI (html) where you wish to 
see the view preview from the camera.  The Cordova WebView control has the same dimensions as <br />
the camera view. In some cases the camera view and WebView sizes maybe smaller <br />
than the device display due to automatic scaling performed by VideoOverlay to <br />
maintain a consistent aspect ratio of the video stream. </p>

<p>When a camera is started it is known as the active camera and it's video is <br />
rendered on the camera view.  At this time the video content is NOT saved to the device's photo gallery. </p>

<h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h2>

<p>The simplest ezAR application involves adding the VideoOverlay plugin <br />
to your Corodva project using the Cordova CLI</p>

<pre><code>    cordova plugin add pathtoezar/com.ezartech.ezar.videooverlay
</code></pre>

<p>Next in your Cordova JavaScript deviceready handler include the following <br />
JavaScript snippet to initialize the VideoOverlay plugin and activate the <br />
camera on the back of the device, i.e., the camera away from the display.</p>

<pre><code>    ezar.initializeVideoOverlay(
        function() {
            ezar.getBackCamera().start();
            },
        function(err) {
            alert('unable to init ezar: ' + err);
    });
</code></pre>
